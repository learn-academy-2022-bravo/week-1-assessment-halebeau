# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer:
 Conditional statements  have well defined instructions that produce a input dependent unique output. Conditional statements are like flow charts and help you create logic in your code. They include else/if statements and usually do return true/false statements also known as Boolean Values. - Kathy Ly


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Git is a version control system and is local. It stores and tracks your code history. Github is a cloud-based platform,owned by Microsoft, that allows multiple developers to collaborate on code and see edits in real time. It can also be used as a networking site as you can set your repos to be public. It's like a portfolio of your code work that you can share with anyone, especially employers. - LJ


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Logical operators return a value of truthy or falsy. Examples of these operators are AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) - CJ Priedel


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Index contains the position of an item in an expression. A value is what a variable is set you. It can be any data type and be changed at any time in Javascript. - Jose Aguilar


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
Iteration in Javascript is code that repeats until a condition is met. These loops are continuously executed to perform specific tasks. - Andrew Luna


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
In pair programming different skill levels can be combined.
 Expert-Expert
 Expert-Novice
 Novice-novice
There are 6 different pair programming techniques.
-Unstructured Pairing: This is a wing it technique, where no party knows of any techniques.
It is trial and error.
-Driver-Navigator: This is the most established style. The driver handles all the typing and navigating between files. The Navigator looks for big concerns and checks for mistakes. This works well with expert-expert, who can switch roles and can be used for expert and novice.
-Backseat Navigator: This is similar to Driver-Navigator, but this is where the Navigator takes over the tactical and strategic role and becomes more controlling, the navigator gives out more detailed instructions. This means this person tells the driver, for example when to open a file or what to name a test or variable. This works well with novice as a drive, with an expert navigator.
-Tour Guide-Works well with an expert-novice. The driver acts as a tour guide for the novice tourist and the other is the tourist on a tour. This technique works well with an expert and a novice. Or with a novice driver, and expert who is observing to provide feedback.
-Ping-Pong Pairing: This technique is used by extreme programmers who switch back and forth on each otherâ€™s code. Where one person writes a failing test, and the other fixes it, and vice versa. This works well for experts.
-Distributed-Is an unofficial pairing method. This is for collaborative programming around the world. Previously collaborative programming was done in person. Now it is being replaced by remote pair programming.  - Neco Armstrong
